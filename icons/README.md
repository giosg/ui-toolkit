### Folder structure
- `style.scss` and `variable.scss`
  - Generated by IcoMoon. These are imported to main file `ui-toolkit.scss`
  - Should not be edited manually.
- `selection.json`
  - Generated by IcoMoon. Should not be edited manually.
- `fonts/`
    - Place the fonts generated by IcoMoon here
    - Should not be edited manually
- `svg/`
    - Place the original icon SVGs here

### How to develop
- You should import *selection.json* back to the IcoMoon app using the *Import Icons* button (or via Main Menu â†’ Manage Projects) to retrieve your icon selection.
- Add new icons and generate the the font.
- You should generate both css and sass files.
  - However for this repo we only need the sass files.
- Download the generated font and extract it to directory
- Make sure all the necessary files are updated
  - New icons should be added to to `svg/`
  - `style.scss` and `variables.scss` should be updated
  - index.html should be updated and new icons should be added there
